# Unofficial Doki Doki Literature Club! site
An unofficial website of [Doki Doki Literature Club! (ddlc.moe)](http://ddlc.moe/) build with Svelte for modern browser.

## Quick Start
Open a terminal window and set the project up...

```
cd /path/to/ddlc
npm install
```

...then start up a development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will serve your app on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) and rebuild it with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) every time you make a change to the files in `ddlc/src`.

Check the project template's [README](https://github.com/sveltejs/template/blob/master/README.md) of Svelte for instructions on how to easily deploy your app.
